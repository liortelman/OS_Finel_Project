## The submission includes:
   - Folders: 
   - This README.md file

This repository is organized in parts (part_1 .. part_10), aligned with the assignment stages.

## Parts checklist
- [ ] part_1 — Graph core (data structure, I/O)
- [ ] part_2 — Euler circuit (Hierholzer)
- [ ] part_3 — Random graph + CLI (getopt)
- [ ] part_4 — Tests + Coverage + gprof
- [ ] part_5 — Valgrind: bug-hunt report
- [ ] part_6 — Server v1 (Euler)
- [ ] part_7 — Algorithms + Strategy/Factory (pick 4)
- [ ] part_8 — Multithreading: Leader-Follower
- [ ] part_9 — Pipeline: Active Objects
- [ ] part_10 — Helgrind/Callgrind + final reports

## Build
From the repository root:
```
make           # builds the current active part(s)
make run_part1 # runs the part_1 demo (after Commit B)
make clean
```
